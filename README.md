# sunrisealarm
Small project to create a lamp that simulates the sunrise to help wake me up in the winter. Using a MiPow PlayBulb Rainbow and running on a Raspberry Pi 2 with USB bluetooth adaptor.

Have moved this over to a Raspberry Pi 3 (with built-in bluetooth) with no changes necessary. Bluetooth connection works more reliably.
